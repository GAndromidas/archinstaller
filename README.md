## Overview

**Archinstaller** automates your Arch Linux post-install setup. It configures your system, installs essential and optional packages, and customizes your desktop environmentâ€”all with minimal user input.

- **Two modes:** Default (full setup) or Minimal (core utilities)
- **Automatic DE detection:** KDE, GNOME, Cosmic, or fallback
- **Idempotent:** Safe to run multiple times

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gandromidas/archinstaller && cd archinstaller
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

- Run as a regular user with sudo privileges.
- Follow the interactive menu.

## Features

- Optimizes Pacman and mirrorlist

---

## Structure

- `install.sh` â€” Main script
