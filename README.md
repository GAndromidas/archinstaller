**Archinstaller** is an advanced post-installation script for Arch Linux that automates the transition from a base system to a fully configured, highly optimized, and ready-to-use desktop environment. It leverages intelligent detection systems to tailor the installation to your specific hardware, ensuring optimal performance and stability.

Built with the Arch Linux philosophy of simplicity and minimalism, Archinstaller provides a clean, professional installation experience with enhanced user interface features including real-time progress tracking, time estimation, and intelligent resume functionality.

## Core Philosophy

This project is built on the principle of **Intelligent Automation**. Instead of providing a one-size-fits-all setup, Archinstaller inspects your system's hardware and software to make smart decisions, applying best-practice configurations that would otherwise require hours of manual research and tweaking.

## Key Features

#### System Intelligence & Automation
*   **Hardware Detection**: Automatically identifies your CPU (Intel/AMD), GPU (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel), storage type (NVMe/SSD/HDD), and laptop-specific hardware to apply tailored configurations.
*   **Driver Management**: Installs the correct graphics drivers, including legacy NVIDIA drivers and VM guest utilities.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Dynamically configures ZRAM swap, I/O schedulers, and memory parameters based on your system's resources.
*   **Desktop Environment Integration**: Applies specific optimizations and keyboard shortcuts for KDE, GNOME, and Cosmic desktops.

#### Robust Features
*   **Btrfs Snapshot System**: Implements a full Btrfs snapshot and recovery solution with `snapper`, including bootloader integration with GRUB for easy rollbacks.
*   **Security Hardening**: Deploys and configures a firewall (`firewalld` or `UFW`) and `Fail2ban` for out-of-the-box system protection.
*   **Optional Gaming Mode**: A one-click setup for a complete gaming environment, including Steam, Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher, MangoHud, and GameMode.
*   **Power Management**: Advanced power-saving features for laptops, including `power-profiles-daemon` or `tuned-ppd`, `thermald` for Intel CPUs, and touchpad gesture support.

#### User Experience
*   **Flexible Installation Modes**: Choose between a feature-rich **Standard** setup, a lightweight **Minimal** installation, or an interactive **Custom** mode to select your own packages.
*   **Enhanced Shell**: Comes with a pre-configured Zsh environment powered by Oh-My-Zsh and the Starship prompt.
*   **Smart Resume Functionality**: The installer tracks its progress and can be safely re-run to resume from the last completed step with an interactive menu showing completed steps.
*   **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars with percentage completion and time estimation for all installation steps.
*   **Professional Interface**: Clean, minimal design following Arch Linux principles with enhanced visual feedback and status updates.

## Installation

#### Prerequisites
*   A fresh, minimal Arch Linux installation with an active internet connection.
*   A regular user account with `sudo` privileges.

#### Quick Start
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gandromidas/archinstaller.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd archinstaller
    ```
3.  **Run the installer:**
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```
The script will present a menu where you can choose your desired installation mode.

#### Installation Experience
The installer provides a modern, user-friendly experience with:
*   **Interactive Menu**: Clean interface powered by `gum` for mode selection and confirmations
*   **Progress Visualization**: Real-time progress bars showing completion percentage for each step
*   **Time Estimation**: Dynamic time estimates that improve as installation progresses
*   **Resume Support**: If interrupted, the installer can resume from the last completed step
*   **Professional Summary**: Minimal, clean installation summary following Arch Linux principles
*   **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes temporary files and packages after successful installation

## Customization
This installer is designed to be easily customized. The package lists for all installation modes are managed in a human-readable YAML file located at `configs/programs.yaml`. You can add or remove packages from these lists to perfectly match your preferences without altering the script logic.
